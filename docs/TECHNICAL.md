# Sprino — Technical Reference

This is the deep-dive companion to the [README](../README.md). It covers
how Sprino is built, why the architecture looks the way it does, and what
you need to know to operate, extend, or audit the codebase.

For the protocol Sprino implements, see
[Tessera SPEC](https://github.com/leotorrealba/tessera/blob/main/SPEC.md).

---

## 1. What Sprino is, technically

Sprino is the **reference implementation** of [Tessera](https://github.com/leotorrealba/tessera),
an open protocol for AI-native project state. Concretely Sprino is:

- A self-hosted PM tool, packaged as Docker Compose.
- A single TypeScript/Hono process exposing **two adapters** over the same
  business logic: HTTP REST for the web UI, and MCP-over-HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0)
  for AI clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc).
- A Postgres-backed event-sourced store with materialized projections.
- A small React/Vite frontend that renders task state and a live event feed.

The codebase is intentionally small. The entire backend is under
`apps/server/src/` and the frontend under `apps/web/src/`.

## 3. The architectural rule (read this first)

> **One Hono process. `/api/*` and `/mcp` are thin adapters over `service/*`.
> All idempotency, version checks, and event-log writes happen ONCE in the
> service layer.**

This is the only architectural rule that matters. It exists because the
failure mode of a dual-adapter system is duplicating business logic on each
side and letting them drift. Concretely:

- A route handler in `adapters/http/` is allowed to: parse input with Zod,
  call a `service/*` function, format the response. Nothing else.
- An MCP tool handler in `adapters/mcp/` is allowed to: the same.
- All database writes, all idempotency lookups, all `if_match` version
  checks, all event-log appends happen inside `service/*` functions.
- Each mutating service function wraps its event-write + projection-update
  in a single Drizzle transaction.

If you find yourself reaching for business logic in an adapter, stop and
move it down a layer. The integration tests will catch drift between
adapters quickly because both adapters hit the same service functions
through different transports.

## 4. Stack (locked)

| Layer | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | TypeScript 5.9 | Shared types between server, web, and protocol-types. |
| Runtime | Bun 1.3 | Fast install + native test runner. Node-compatible at runtime. |
| HTTP | Hono | Edge-ready, tiny, middleware-friendly. Same process for HTTP + MCP. |
| ORM | Drizzle | Typed SQL, no runtime overhead, schema-as-code. |
| DB | Postgres 16 | Event log + JSON columns + LISTEN/NOTIFY (deferred to v0.2). |
| Validation | Zod | Single source of truth for request shapes; exports JSON Schema. |
| MCP | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | Official SDK; we mount it as Hono routes. |
| Frontend | Vite + React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind | Stock React stack — the UI is a thin viewer. |
| Realtime | SSE + 10s polling fallback | Simpler than WebSockets; works behind any proxy. |
| Deploy | Docker Compose | Single VPS, no orchestration. |

Versions are pinned to exact minors in `package.json`; do not use ranges.

## 5. Data model

Tessera defines five core resources. Sprino's Drizzle schema
(`apps/server/src/db/schema.ts`) maps them 1:1 to Postgres tables:

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `actors` | Humans + AI agents. `kind` discriminates (`human` / `agent`). |
| `projects` | Scope boundary. Tasks belong to a project. |
| `tasks` | Materialized task state — projection of the event log. |
| `events` | Append-only authoritative log. **Source of truth.** |
| `operations` | Idempotency dedup records (UUIDv7, 30-day retention). |

### Event sourcing

- Every mutating operation writes an event row **before** updating the
  materialized `tasks` row, in the same transaction.
- `tasks.status`, `tasks.assignee_id`, and `tasks.version` are projections
  of the latest matching event.
- Replaying the event log in `created_at` order MUST yield the same
  materialized state. This is the contract that lets us evolve projections
  without losing history.

### Idempotency

Clients supply a UUIDv7 `operation_id` on every mutating verb. The flow:

1. Compute `request_hash = sha256(canonical_json(request_body))`.
2. Look up the operation row.
3. **Hit, same hash** → return the cached response verbatim. No new event.
4. **Hit, different hash** → return `409 Conflict` with the cached response
   (the original wins; the second request is treated as a programming error).
5. **Miss** → execute, then INSERT operation row + event + projection
   update, all in one transaction.
6. Operations expire after 30 days; expired retries return `410 Gone`.

This is implemented in `service/idempotency.ts`. Both adapters call it; no
adapter is allowed to short-circuit it.

### Optimistic concurrency

Every mutating verb takes `if_match: <version>`. On match, server writes
the event and increments the version. On mismatch, server returns
`409 Conflict` with the **server's current task body** so the client can
re-read and retry.

This exists because AI agents tend not to pause to check state before
writing. Last-write-wins would be a footgun.

---

## 6. Request flow

### HTTP (REST)

```
client → Hono → bearer auth middleware → route handler (adapters/http)
       → service/<verb>(...) → Drizzle transaction → Postgres
       → SSE bus broadcast (if mutating) → response
```

### MCP-over-HTTP

```
agent → Hono → /mcp endpoint → MCP SDK JSON-RPC dispatch
      → tool handler (adapters/mcp) → service/<verb>(...) → ... (same as above)
```

The two adapters converge on `service/*` after argument parsing. The
service layer is transport-agnostic; it neither knows nor cares whether
its caller arrived via HTTP or MCP.

### Auth

- HTTP and MCP both require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Tokens are loaded from the `SPRINO_ACTORS_JSON` env var at startup
  (`auth/registry.ts`). Each token maps to an actor (human or agent).
- The middleware attaches the resolved `actor` to the request context.
  Service functions read it from there for `created_by` fields and the
  event log's actor reference.
- For SSE, browsers can't set custom headers on `EventSource`, so we issue
  short-lived **stream tickets** signed with HMAC-SHA256 over
  `${actorId}.${projectId}.${exp}`. Clients exchange a Bearer token for a
  ticket, then connect with `?ticket=<base64url>`.

### Realtime

- Mutating service functions broadcast events to a process-local SSE bus
  after the transaction commits.
- HTTP clients subscribe to `/api/events/stream?ticket=...&project_id=...`.
- The frontend falls back to a 10-second poll if SSE drops. This is
  deliberately simple — no LISTEN/NOTIFY across instances yet (deferred to
  v0.2 when multi-tenant lands).

## 7. Operations

### Self-host

The 30-minute walkthrough lives in the [README](../README.md#self-host).
Summary:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leotorrealba/sprino.git
cd sprino
sh bootstrap.sh                       # generates .env
docker compose --profile full up -d   # postgres + server + web + backup sidecar
```

Print the admin token from `.env`, open `http://localhost:3000`, paste
name + token, create a task. The `full` profile includes a nightly
`pg_dump` sidecar that writes timestamped dumps to `./backups/`.

### Backup & restore

- The `backup` service runs `pg_dump` on a cron and writes to a mounted
  volume. Retention is configurable via `BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS`.
- Restore playbook: [`docs/RESTORE.md`](./RESTORE.md).
- The restore script (`scripts/backup.test.sh`) is exercised in CI.

### Token rotation

- Bearer tokens live in `SPRINO_ACTORS_JSON`. Rotation = edit env, restart
  server. The full playbook (planned rotation, leak response, full reset)
  is in [`docs/TOKEN-ROTATION.md`](./TOKEN-ROTATION.md).
- Stream-ticket secrets rotate independently (`SPRINO_STREAM_SECRET`).

### Pagination & limits

- `events.list` — limit ≤ 1000.
- `tasks.list` — limit ≤ 500.
- `agents.list` — limit ≤ 100.
- All return `next_cursor` for keyset pagination. The contract is locked
  for v0.1 in Tessera and tested in `pagination.test.ts`.

---

## 8. Testing

The test discipline is documented in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). Summary:

- **Protocol layer = TDD against Tessera fixtures.** Conformance tests in
  `apps/server/test/conformance.test.ts` replay every `*.req.json` /
  `*.res.json` pair from the sibling `tessera/conformance/fixtures/`
  directory against a live server.
- **Integration tests** for `service/*` and adapters use a real Postgres
  (Testcontainers in CI; locally a Docker Compose `postgres` service on
  port 5433). No mocks of Drizzle, no in-memory shims.
- **Unit tests sparingly.** Reserved for pure functions: idempotency hash,
  event-log replay, base64url encoding.
- **No frontend tests in v0.1.** The frontend is a thin viewer; correctness
  is enforced at the protocol layer.

Run locally:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://sprino:sprino@localhost:5433/sprino_test \
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://sprino:sprino@localhost:5433/sprino_test \
bun run test
```

Current state: 9 test files, 82 tests, all passing.

## 9. Tessera ↔ Sprino split (where things go)

When deciding whether a change belongs in this repo or the protocol repo,
ask: **would a second implementer also need to make the same decision?**

| Lives in Tessera (`../tessera/`) | Lives in Sprino (this repo) |
| --- | --- |
| JSON Schemas for resources/verbs | Drizzle schema, Postgres queries |
| Conformance fixtures | Hono routes, MCP tool registrations |
| `SPEC.md`, semver rules, deprecation policy | Docker setup, frontend, dogfood UX |
| The shape of `task.create` itself | How `task.create` is wired to `service/tasks.ts` |
| Idempotency *rules* (UUIDv7, 30-day, 409-on-mismatch) | Idempotency *implementation* (`service/idempotency.ts`) |

If you find yourself wanting to relax a Tessera rule to fit a Sprino
constraint, you are working at the wrong layer — open an issue on Tessera
instead.

## 10. License

Sprino is [AGPL v3](../LICENSE). Tessera is MIT. The split is deliberate:
protocols belong to everyone, reference implementations should keep their
improvements in the commons. If your use case can't accept AGPL, talk to
us about a commercial license.
